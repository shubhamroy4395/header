# Reusable Header Component for React Native
This component is a reusable one which can be used to give headers to a particular react native app. It supports props called headerText to which we can pass the value of the desired text to be given to the header.

# Usage
To use the component :
1. Place it in a desired folder.
2. import the component to you JS file using "import Header from "your pathname";
3. Use the header component as Header headerText="your header text here" within JSX self closing tags.

That's it.
